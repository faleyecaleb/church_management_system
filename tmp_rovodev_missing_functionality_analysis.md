## üîç CONTROLLERS WITH MISSING NAVIGATION

Based on analysis of existing controllers vs. sidebar navigation:

### Missing from Sidebar:
1. **Audit Logs** (`AuditLogController`)
   - Route exists: `Route::resource('audit-logs', AuditLogController::class)`
   - Missing from navigation

2. **Roles & Permissions** (`RoleController`, `PermissionController`)
   - Routes exist: `Route::resource('roles', RoleController::class)`
   - Routes exist: `Route::resource('permissions', PermissionController::class)`
   - Missing from navigation

3. **Service Schedules** (`ServiceScheduleController`)
   - Controller exists but no routes found
   - Missing from navigation

4. **Membership Status Management**
   - Routes added but not in main navigation
   - Could be added as submenu under Members

### Partially Implemented:
1. **Reports** (`ReportController`)
   - Extensive routes exist under `/reports` prefix
   - Not prominently featured in navigation
   - Could benefit from dedicated Reports section

## üìã RECOMMENDED NAVIGATION ADDITIONS

### 1. Administration Section
Add a new "Administration" dropdown with:
- Audit Logs
- Roles & Permissions
- System Settings

### 2. Enhanced Members Section
Add to existing Members dropdown:
- Membership Status Management
- Member Documents (already exists in routes)
- Emergency Contacts (already exists in routes)

### 3. Reports Section
Add dedicated "Reports" dropdown with:
- Dashboard
- Membership Reports
- Attendance Reports
- Financial Reports
- Communication Reports
- Growth Reports
- Custom Reports

## üéØ VIEWS THAT NEED TO BE CREATED

Based on controllers that have routes but may be missing views:

### Complaints System:
- ‚úÖ `resources/views/complaints/index.blade.php` (exists)
- ‚ùì Other complaint views (create, edit, show) - need verification

### Donations System:
- ‚ùì `resources/views/donations/` directory - needs creation
- ‚ùì All donation views (index, create, edit, show, report)

### Membership Status:
- ‚ùì `resources/views/membership/status/` directory - needs creation
- ‚ùì All membership status views

### Missing View Directories:
- `resources/views/donations/`
- `resources/views/membership/`
- `resources/views/audit-logs/`
- `resources/views/roles/`
- `resources/views/permissions/`

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Priority:**
   - Create missing view files for Donations
   - Create missing view files for Membership Status
   - Test all newly added routes

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Add Administration section to sidebar
   - Add Reports section to sidebar
   - Create missing views for Audit Logs, Roles, Permissions

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Enhance existing sections with missing sub-items
